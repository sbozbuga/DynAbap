## 2026-06-16 - Add success toast messages for report executions
**Learning:** Background processes or reports that execute silently on success leave the user guessing if their action worked. Adding a simple status message (e.g. `MESSAGE '...' TYPE 'S'`) provides immediate, clear confirmation.
**Action:** Always include a success message for UI actions that do not otherwise provide clear visual feedback or state changes upon successful completion.
