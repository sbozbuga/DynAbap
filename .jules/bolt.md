## 2024-06-14 - Replacing SELECT...ENDSELECT with Array Fetches in ABAP
**Learning:** The ABAP `SELECT...ENDSELECT` loop construct issues a separate database trip for every matching row, causing a significant N+1-like performance bottleneck in code loops. Using `SELECT ... INTO TABLE ...` fetches all rows in a single DB round-trip and allows us to iterate over them locally in memory with `LOOP AT`.
**Action:** Always favor `SELECT ... INTO TABLE ...` combined with `LOOP AT` instead of using `SELECT...ENDSELECT` loops for database access to reduce DB latency significantly. Note that `sy-subrc` will need to be cached if its check happens *after* the `LOOP AT` block.
