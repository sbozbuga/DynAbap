## 2024-07-10 - Consolidated JOINs eliminate ABAP N+1 patterns
**Learning:** Sequential `SELECT SINGLE` queries across linked tables (like `qmfe`, `ekkn`, `aufk`, `vbap`, `vbkd`) cause severe N+1 database roundtrip latency, a common legacy anti-pattern.
**Action:** Consolidate these into a single database hit using `LEFT OUTER JOIN`s, maintaining intermediate checks to preserve explicit fallback behaviors where downstream lookup failures don't clobber earlier values.
## 2025-01-28 - Consolidate independent sequential lookups into single DB hit
**Learning:** Legacy ABAP code often performs sequential `SELECT SINGLE` lookups based on an initial order ID (e.g. from `aufk`, then `vbak`, `afru`, `qmel` in separate queries). This triples or quadruples DB latency compared to a single roundtrip.
**Action:** Use `LEFT OUTER JOIN`s to fetch all dependent properties simultaneously in a single `SELECT SINGLE ... INTO (...)` statement, but carefully preserve the explicit backend exception behavior if intermediate logical conditions (e.g. `vbtyp NE 'G'`) fail.
## 2025-01-29 - Consolidate independent sequential lookups into single DB hit (equi/equz)
**Learning:** Sequential `SELECT SINGLE` queries on different tables (like `equi` and `equz`) that share a primary key (`equnr`) can be combined to reduce N+1-style DB roundtrips.
**Action:** Use `LEFT OUTER JOIN`s to fetch all dependent properties simultaneously in a single query when the base key is the same, reducing overhead significantly.
## 2026-07-27 - Sort before DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES
**Learning:** In ABAP, `DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES` only removes consecutive identical rows. If an internal table is not sorted by the exact fields being compared, duplicate entries that are not adjacent will remain in the table, silently causing memory bloat and breaking downstream `BINARY SEARCH` assumptions.
**Action:** Always add an explicit `SORT` statement by the comparison keys immediately before calling `DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES` to guarantee accurate deduplication and correct binary search behavior downstream.
