## 2024-07-10 - Consolidated JOINs eliminate ABAP N+1 patterns
**Learning:** Sequential `SELECT SINGLE` queries across linked tables (like `qmfe`, `ekkn`, `aufk`, `vbap`, `vbkd`) cause severe N+1 database roundtrip latency, a common legacy anti-pattern.
**Action:** Consolidate these into a single database hit using `LEFT OUTER JOIN`s, maintaining intermediate checks to preserve explicit fallback behaviors where downstream lookup failures don't clobber earlier values.
